# The Image Inspector  

We are building a tool that automatically processes images from books. Our system will:  

- **Segment images** from scanned pages  
- **Generate captions** using AI  
- **Enhance image understanding** with deep learning  

Using advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to make historical and printed book images more accessible and usable.  

This project will help researchers, libraries, and digital archives extract and analyze visual content effortlessly.
